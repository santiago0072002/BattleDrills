I started working on Battle Drills for the cyber world.

Each battle drill might or might not have individual tasks. 

I will be dummying the process of learning defensive operations and offensive operations in a way that Grunts can understand.

The drills will be block-chained, thus allowing me with the ability to check if any of the data and where if is being tampered. 

Battle drill 1 - protective Ambush. 

Set up honey pots - “ battle drill 2 “ 

Direct traffic to specifics ports, 

Set up one honey port for every other port open.

Only open ports known by offensive tools.

Automate the process of detection. 

When setting up honey pots ensure there is a mechanism to lock the intrusive system, 

Ensure Mechanism can tell if is a VM and if true, employ vm escape code. (Battle drill 4 - breaching an obstacle ) 

Move to battle drill 3 - (knock out system) 

Ensure logs are captured, add determine ip source. 

Check database of known VPN providers and follow VPN traffic, do not block vpn company. We are looking for the source ip of the router.
